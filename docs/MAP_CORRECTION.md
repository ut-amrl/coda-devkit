We describe the steps we took to obtain pseudo-ground truth global poses.

# LeGO-LOAM Poses
1. Generate poses.txt using LeGO-LOAM to start with.

# Poses alignment
3. Project poses on a global map to align trajectories in each route.

# Global maps alignment
4. Generate global maps.
5. Align these global maps in each route.
